# ALPR with Rich Features with Multimodal Model

## Idea

Build a fast and simple prototype for ALPR with rich feature such as make, model, and vehicle color classification using multimodal model for advanced text and image reasoning.

Pros:

- Development speed and simplicity. Single model can handle multiple task.
- Flexibility. Modifying the attributes or information that will be recognized as simple as changing the prompt.
- Contextual Understanding.

Cons:

- Cost and Latency Usage
- Control and Interpretability
- Accuracy Consistency 

## Tech Stack

- OpenAI API / HuggingFace
